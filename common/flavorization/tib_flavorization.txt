# Accepted categories are: governments, name_lists, heritages, faiths, religions
# A Flavorization will apply if ALL specified categories have ANY of their entries
# represented in the character/title
# So for example:
# governments = { feudal_government }
# heritages = { mongolic_group central_germanic_group }
# For this to apply a character MUST BE feudal, AND must also be EITHER altaic OR germanic
# priority is used to determine priority, if they are the same then the LAST will be selected,
# and honorifics will be prefered over landed titles. Default priority is 1
# If a flavorization does not have a tier it can apply to all tiers of characters, too many non-tiered
# flavorizations is bad for performance though, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
# 'top_liege = no' means that its the holder of the title causing the honorific that is tested for
# 'only_holder = yes' means that this will only be applied to the person holding the title, not their spouse and such
# the various categories, so for a prince it is the king that is tested, for a queen mother it is her son
# if this is not specified ( or 'top_liege = yes' the default ) then it is the top liege of that character
# that is tested, this means that most title flavor comes from the top liege of the title not the holder
