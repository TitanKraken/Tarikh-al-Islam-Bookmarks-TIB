#Succession Expanded file. Only does anything with SE
#Removed the Frankish part as I just edit the needed titles in title history as SE's setup makes ALL of France male only which impacts titles that very much did allow woman to inherit and also then makes Navarra male only in later bookmarks when it's held by Frankish rulers
