 british_culture.0002.desc:0 "After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, various Germanic tribes began to migrate to the British Isles, among them the Jutes, Angles and Saxons who would go on to form their own petty kingdoms across much the land they settled. After a lengthy period of expansion against the native Britons and consolidation of surrounding tribes, Kingdoms like Kent, Mercia and Northumbria would gradually start to forge new regional cultures unique to the isle with their own dialects and identities. This would slowly change with the Viking invasion that saw fall of many of these old kingdoms in rapid succession with the rest gradually being absorbed into what would later become England. As such, a new culture has begun to emerge, one that is defined by the shared faith, origin and tongue of these native Germanics of Britain, that stands in a contrast to those from across the sea. At last, these people have started to see themselves no longer as Mercians, West Saxons or Kents, but as a common English people."

 british_culture.0011.t:0 "The Divergence of Brythonic"
 british_culture.0011.desc:0 "Since the Fall of Caergloui to the Anglo-Saxons, the Britons of Britannia and Brittany have slowly but steadily diverged from one another. After centuries of relative isolation, two unique Brittonic varieties have emerged from the dialects of Dumnonia and Cambria respectively: while both continue to identify as Brythonic, the variety of each area has become largely unintelligible to the other."

 balkan_culture.0002.desc:0 "When the Kingdom of Bosnia was established, not many could have imagined the renaissance it would bring; Independent from both Serbia and Croatia, the people of the Central Dindaric Alps and along the Bosna River have begun to see themselves as neither Serb nor Croat, but as a new and distinct Bosnian people with their own culture and heritage, both founded in our very kingdom. "

 balkan_culture.0004.t:0 "The Illyrian People"
 balkan_culture.0004.desc:0 "When the Slavs first migrated into the Balkans in the 6th century, they consisted of many disparate tribes who were simply fleeing from the invading Avars. Settled by the Byzantines in the former province of Illyricum, these Slavs would gradually gain their independence and establish their own polities such as Duklija, Raška or Croatia, but ultimately remain divided and fall subject to outside powers repeatedly. But at last, no longer – We have not just managed to unite our own region, but managed to expand far beyond it, incorporating much of former Illyricum into our realm. With all the Slavic tribes finally united under a single ruler, the time has come to truly bind our people together and to embrace the Illyrian heritage."

 rus_culture.0002.t:0 "The Rus’ People"
 rus_culture.0002.desc:0 "Many decades have passed since the Norse invaded the lands of the Eastern Slavs. But as time has passed, so have the Norse increasingly adopted the locals’ tongue and customs; simultaneously, the Norse have lent their knowledge in government and warfare to the Slavs they rule over, creating a new identity that transcends the old."
