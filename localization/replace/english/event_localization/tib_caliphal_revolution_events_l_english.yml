The Ummah deserves a ruler who will lead with wisdom and compassion. [THIS.Char.GetFaith.GetReligiousHead.GetTitledFirstName]'s actions have caused unrest and discontent among our people. He claims divine authority, but his deeds betray his true intentions. It is time for a change, a new dawn for the Ummah. With the support of the court imam, he has declared me the rightful Caliph at the grand mosque, and the people are rallying behind me. I must seize this opportunity to liberate our Ummah from the shackles of tyranny. The people yearn for a leader who upholds justice and piety, who brings unity and prosperity to our lands."
